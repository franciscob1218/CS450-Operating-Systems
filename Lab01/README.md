# DELIVERABLE #1: Building

## Initial Setup:

<aside>
üí° You will want to install the gcc complier and the qemu programs. This can be done by running the commands below for you linux terminal. Personally I used WSL (Windows Subsystem for linux) for this project.

</aside>

```bash
$ sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade
$ sudo apt-get install git build-essential gdb-multiarch qemu-system-misc gcc-riscv64-linux-gnu binutils-riscv64-linux-gnu
```

<aside>
üí° I usually find running the first set of commands again will yield more updates.

You can check that Make, Qemu, and GCC are working correctly by trying the following commands:

</aside>

```bash
# in the xv6 directory
$ make qemu
# ... lots of output ...
init: starting sh
$
```

<aside>
üí° If that doesn't work, you can double check individual components. Which include QEMU:

</aside>

```bash
$ qemu-system-riscv64 --version
QEMU emulator version 5.1.0

```

<aside>
üí° And at least one RISC-V version of GCC:

</aside>

```bash
$ riscv64-linux-gnu-gcc --version
					riscv64-linux-gnu-gcc (Debian 10.3.0-8) 10.3.0
OR...
$ riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc --version
					riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc (GCC) 10.1.0
OR...
$ riscv64-unknown-linux-gnu-gcc --version
					riscv64-unknown-linux-gnu-gcc (GCC) 10.1.0
```

## Building and executing Programming Assignment #1:

<aside>
üí° To start you will want to navigate to the folder containing the Programming Assignment Files. for me this looks like:

          ‚Äùfbarba@FratDesktop:~/Projects/CS450-Operating-Systems/Lab01$‚Äù

In that folder you will find ‚Äú./t.sh‚Äù this is a script that will run and execute build commands.

</aside>

```bash
# in the PA1 folder
~/Lab01$ ./t.sh

# Notice: sh.c built into shell.out
# Notice: whatif.c built into whatif.out
# Notice: Changed the permissions of both built files
# Notice: Running Shell Now!

 $S23
```

```powershell
gcc ./sh.c -o "./shell.out"
echo "# Notice: sh.c built into shell.out"

gcc ./whatif.c -o "./whatif.out"
echo "# Notice: whatif.c built into whatif.out"

chmod +wrx ./shell.out
chmod +wrx ./whatif.out
echo "# Notice: Changed the permissions of both built files"

echo "# Notice: Running Shell Now!"
./shell.out
```

<aside>
üí° This script creates 2 files "shell.out" & "whatif.out" and it changes the files permissions

- "shell.out" is our actual shell program and we can enter it by just calling it in the terminal: "./shell.out"
- "whatif.out" is our created program and we can start the program just by calling it in the shell: "./whatif.out"
- the ‚Äú*.out‚Äù files have their permissions changed so that we can run them each time they are created with no extra problems.

# DELIVERABLE #2: Code Modification

## sh.c Modifications:

```c

# DELIVERABLE #3: whatif Behavior

## Behavior:

See this program for a simple illustration of process branching and inter-process communication to write to two different output files. The program starts with some header files  required for later functions. The next step in the main() function is to set the file descriptor variable to zero. The open() system call is used to try to open a file when the program is called with command line arguments. Standard error receives an error message, and  if the file cannot be opened, the program exits with an error status.

Using the open() system call, the program creates two new files, "child.txt" and "parent.txt". With permissions 0644, these files are opened in write-only mode and existing data  is deleted. If either file cannot be created, you receive an error message on standard error and the program exits with an error status. After the output file is created, the program  enters a while loop to read input data from previously opened files or standard input. The fgets() function is used to read data into a buffer. The fgets() function reads until it encounters a newline, end of file, or sizeof(buf) character. The loop continues until there is no more input data to read. Using the fork() system call, the program starts a new child process for each input line. By duplicating the calling process, the fork() system call starts a new process.

The original process is called the parent process and the new process is called the child process. Using the write() system call, the program writes the data from the buffer to the child.txt file  and  exits the child process with  success status. The program uses the write() system call in the parent process to write data from the buffer to the parent.txt file. Then use the wait() system call in the child process to wait for the child process to exit. Forking a new child process, writing to the output file, and waiting for the child process to complete are all steps that the parent process performs after the child process exits. The parent process then proceeds to the next input line. The program closes the output file after processing all input data. It also closes the input file if it is open. The program then exits with a success status. I believe that the expectation was for the program to have issues reading the same lines from each other to avoid this error and issue I used a char buffer. In general, this program demonstrates how to use  multiple processes and inter-process communication to write data to two different output files. Child processes are created using the fork() system call, and both  parent and child processes communicate using file descriptors to write to the appropriate files.

# DELIVERABLE #4: Test data sets

## Test Sets:

<aside>
üí° These are a good set of testing measures because I am using 3 cases and also each case has a slightly longer process time than the last and this will com in handy for testing ‚Äú;‚Äù cases. These cases will be structured out by the main ones and then the moddified version of the test.

.TH WHATIF 1 "February 2023" "1.0" "whatif man page"

.SH NAME
whatif - write input data to parent and child output files

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B whatif
[FILE]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B whatif
reads input data from a file or standard input and writes it to two output files: "child.txt" and "parent.txt". Each line of input data is written to both output files in parallel using two separate processes.

If a FILE argument is provided, the program reads input data from that file. If no FILE argument is provided, the program reads input data from standard input.

.SH OPTIONS
The following options are supported:

.TP
.B FILE
The name of the input file to read from.

.SH RETURN VALUE
.B whatif
exits with a status of 0 on success, or a non-zero status on failure.

.SH EXAMPLES
To write input data from a file called "input.txt" to the output files "child.txt" and "parent.txt", run the following command:

.B whatif input.txt

To write input data from standard input to the output files "child.txt" and "parent.txt", run the following command:

.B whatif

.SH FILES
.TP
.B child.txt
Output file for child process.

.TP
.B parent.txt
Output file for parent process.

.SH SEE ALSO
fork(2), wait(2), open(2), fgets(3), write(2), perror(3), exit(3)
